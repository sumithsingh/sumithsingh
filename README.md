### My Journey: From Curiosity to Creation

My fascination with technology began not just with code, but with a question: how can we use the vast amounts of data we generate to solve meaningful, real-world problems? This question led me down the path of Data Science and Deep Learning, where I discovered my passion for building intelligent systems that can learn, predict, and ultimately, create value for the community.

Today, I am focused on building complete, end-to-end applications that are not only technically robust but also intuitive and impactful. I am currently seeking a **Data Science Internship** to apply my skills to new challenges and contribute to a team that shares my passion for innovation.

### ‚úàÔ∏è SkyPrix: An MLOps Pipeline for Flight Price Prediction
**[Explore the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/sumithsingh/dsp-skyprix)**

SkyPrix is more than a prediction model; it is a complete, automated MLOps pipeline designed to deliver reliable, real-time flight price predictions. The system handles everything from data ingestion and validation to model serving and performance monitoring.

*   **What It Solves:** Provides a robust and scalable solution for predicting flight prices, addressing challenges like data quality and model maintenance through automation.
*   **My Role:** I designed and implemented the end-to-end workflow, including the data validation pipeline with Great Expectations, the automated prediction jobs with Airflow, and the user-facing API.
*   **Key Features:**
    -   A user-friendly web interface for on-demand predictions.
    -   An automated Airflow pipeline for continuous data processing.
    -   Rigorous data quality validation to ensure model reliability.
    -   A monitoring dashboard to track system health and data drift.
